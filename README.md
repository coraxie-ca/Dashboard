# Zen's Dashboard

# What it does
A revamped dashboard for Zen's spaceship, we made it using Processing and tried to get it to work with data collected by Raspberry Pi Pico with an Accelerometer GY-521 and a button using Arduino. However, you can control the "Speed" setting on the dashboard by pressing the up and down keys on your keyboard.

# How we built it
We used Processing (specifically the controlp5 library @ https://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/) to build the revamped UI! Arduino to simulate the functionality of buttons interacting with the user interface.

# Challenges we ran into
Getting the Arduino to work with our code in Processing.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
# What we learned
Processing is pretty cool and simple to work with + make cool art with!
